        "# Training Autonomous Driving Policies in VISTA\n",
        "Autonomous control has traditionally be dominated by algorithms that explicitly decompose individual aspects of the control pipeline. For example, in autonomous driving, traditional methods work by first detecting road and lane boundaries, and then using path planning and rule-based methods to derive a control policy. Deep learning offers something very different -- the possibility of optimizing all these steps simultaneously, learning control end-to-end directly from raw sensory inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**You will explore the power of deep learning to learn autonomous control policies that are trained *end-to-end, directly from raw sensory data, and entirely within a simulated world*.**\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use the data-driven simulation engine [VISTA](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8957584&tag=1), which uses techniques in computer vision to synthesize new photorealistic trajectories and driving viewpoints, that are still consistent with the world's appearance and fall within the envelope of a real driving scene. This is a powerful approach -- we can synthesize data that is photorealistic, grounded in the real world, and then use this data for training and testing autonomous vehicle control policies within this simulator.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this part of the lab, you will use reinforcement lerning to build a self-driving agent with a neural network-based controller trained on RGB camera data. We will train the self-driving agent for the task of lane following. Beyond this data modality and control task, VISTA also supports [different data modalities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12083.pdf) (such as LiDAR data) and [different learning tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12137.pdf) (such as multi-car interactions).\n",

As with Cartpole, we will use a *policy gradient* method that aims to **maximize** the likelihood of actions that result in large rewards. However, there are some key differences. In Cartpole, the agent's action space was discrete: it could only move left or right. In driving, the agent's action space is continuous: the control network is outputting a curvature, which is a continuous variable. We will define a probability distribution, defined by a mean and variance, over this continuous action space to define the possible actions the self-driving agent can take.\n",

This will take the form of a Normal distribuion and will be defined using TensorFlow probability's [`tfp.distributions.Normal`](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/Normal) function, so the model's prediction will include both a mean and variance. Operates on an instance `driving_model` defined above.\n",

Now, with an eye towards the lab competition, think about what you can change -- about the controller model, your data, your learning algorithm... -- to improve performance even further. Below in 3.11 we have some suggestions to get you started. We hope to see your self-driving control policy put to the ***real*** test!"
